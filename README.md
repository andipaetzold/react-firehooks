# React Firehooks üî•ü™ù

Lightweight dependency-free collection of React hooks for Firebase.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-firehooks
```

or

```sh
yarn add react-firehooks
```

## Compatibility

-   [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase): 9.0.0 or greater
-   [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react): 16.8.0 or greater

If you are using Firebase 8 or earlier, please use [`react-firebase-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-firebase-hooks).

## Migrate from React Firebase Hooks

If you previously used [`react-firebase-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-firebase-hooks) or [`react-firebase9-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-firebase9-hooks) and want to migrate to `react-firehooks`, please read this [migration document](https://github.com/andipaetzold/react-firehooks/blob/main/migrations/react-firebase-hooks.md) to learn what has changed and how your code needs to be adjusted.

## Usage

[Type Documentation](https://andipaetzold.github.io/react-firehooks)

This library consists of 4 modules with many hooks:

-   [`auth`](#Auth)
    -   [`useAuthState`](#useAuthState)
-   [`database`](#Database)
    -   [`useObject`](#useObject)
    -   [`useObjectOnce`](#useObjectOnce)
    -   [`useObjectValue`](#useObjectValue)
    -   [`useObjectValueOnce`](#useObjectValueOnce)
-   [`firestore`](#Firestore)
    -   [`useCollection`](#useCollection)
    -   [`useCollectionData`](#useCollectionData)
    -   [`useCollectionDataOnce`](#useCollectionDataOnce)
    -   [`useCollectionOnce`](#useCollectionOnce)
    -   [`useDocument`](#useDocument)
    -   [`useDocumentData`](#useDocumentData)
    -   [`useDocumentDataOnce`](#useDocumentataOnce)

## Resources

### React Firebase Hooks

This library is heavily inspired by [`react-firebase-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-firebase-hooks). Unfortunately, it didn't receive any updates anymore and didn't support Firebase 9. `react-firehooks` is not a fork but a completely new code base exporting almost identical hooks.
